# Cocoa JavaScript
by Paula Muldoon

This project will become an `npm` library to run parameterised testing in JS.

### Instructions
- Run `npm install`
- To run all unit tests: `npm run tests`
- To run specific unit test file: `npx mocha test/TESTFILE`
- To run the test coverage: `npm run coverage`
- To run the linter: `npm run eslint`
- Note: there is a pre-commit hook in place which runs the test coverage and linter. You will not be allowed to commit without 95% coverage and 0 linter errors/warnings.
